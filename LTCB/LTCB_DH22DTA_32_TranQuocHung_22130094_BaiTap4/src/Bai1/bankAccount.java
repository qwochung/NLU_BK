	/**
	 * Design a data representation for this problem:

. . . Develop a “bank account” program. The program keeps
track of the balances in a person’s bank accounts. Each account
has an id number and a customer’s name. There are three kinds
of accounts: a checking account, a savings account, and a
certificate of deposit (CD). Checking account information also
includes the minimum balance. Savings account includes the
interest rate. A CD specifies the interest rate and the maturity
date. Naturally, all three types come with a current balance. . . .
	 
	*
	*    Example :
	*    		Earl Gray, id# 1729, has $1,250 in a checking account with
minimum balance of $500;

				Ima Flatt, id# 4104, has $10,123 in a certificate of deposit
whose interest rate is 4% and whose maturity date is June 1,
2005;

				Annie Proulx, id# 2992, has $800 in a savings account; the
account yields interest at the rate of 3.5%.
